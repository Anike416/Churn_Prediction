# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction App (with ANN & Streamlit)

This is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on their banking profile. It uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built in **TensorFlow** and offers an interactive **Streamlit** interface for real-time predictions.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧠 Trained **ANN** model (`model.h5`)
- 📊 Predicts churn (Yes/No) for customers
- 🌐 Streamlit frontend for user input
- 🛠️ Preprocessing with **StandardScaler**, **LabelEncoder**, and **OneHotEncoder**
- 📁 Clean modular structure
- 💻 Local run support

     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
     ```
     conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (Optional)
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
       ```
       conda activate <Environment_Name>/
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**
   - Start the project by running the appropriate command.
     ```
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
6. **Access the Project**
   - Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.
