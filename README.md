# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction App (with ANN & Streamlit)

This is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on their banking profile. It uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built in **TensorFlow** and offers an interactive **Streamlit** interface for real-time predictions.
